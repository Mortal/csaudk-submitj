Data structures in the Java standard library
============================================

In ADS we see a number of different data structures, such as queues, stacks,
priority queues, balanced binary search trees (red/black trees), and more.

Most of the data structures are available in the Java standard library,
but sometimes the names of the appropriate classes are not straightforward.

Here is a list of some data structures that might be useful to you
when solving the ADS coding exercises. Click on the individual class
to see how to use it.

| Name in CLRS4 | Corresponding Java class |
| --- | --- |
| Balanced binary search tree | [TreeSet](TreeSet.md) |
| Max-heap | [PriorityQueue](PriorityQueue.md) with custom [comparator](maxheap.md) |
| Min-heap | [PriorityQueue](PriorityQueue.md) |
| Priority queue | [PriorityQueue](PriorityQueue.md) |
| Queue | [Deque](Deque.md) |
| Red/black search tree | [TreeSet](TreeSet.md) |
| Stack | [Deque](Deque.md) |

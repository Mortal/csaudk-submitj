FADS programming exercises
==========================

Intended audience: Students of *Foundations of Algorithms and Data Structures* (FADS), Aarhus University.

In FADS, you have to solve a number of programming tasks along the way.
The programming tasks should be solved in Java using the [BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org/) programming environment.

To solve a programming task, first find the task either in
[Blackboard](https://blackboard.au.dk/webapps/blackboard/execute/launcher?type=Course&id=_66529_1)
or in the [tasks list](tasks/README.md) of this repository.
Read the task description, and start solving the task!

To upload your solution, you need three things:

  * Task ID (from the task description)
  * Username (`fads17-daN-MM`, where `N` is your class and `MM` is your Blackboard group number)
  * Password (from your TA)

If you have technical problems, contact Mathias Rav on the Blackboard discussion board.

Step-by-step guide
------------------

1. Open BlueJ

   ![Blank BlueJ](screenshots/001-blank-bluej.png)

1. Click "New Project..."

   ![Project menu](screenshots/002-project-menu.png)

1. Save the new project somewhere

   ![New project dialog](screenshots/003-new-project-dialog.png)

1. In the edit menu, select "Add Class from File..."

   ![Edit menu](screenshots/004-edit-menu.png)

1. Select the skeleton Java file for the problem you're solving and the Submit.java file

   ![Select Java files](screenshots/005-select-java-files.png)

1. Click "Compile" to ensure that the code you're given can compile. If it doesn't compile, write to Mathias Rav on the Blackboard discussion board.

   ![Click compile](screenshots/006-click-compile.png)

1. Click `testAll()` on the task class to see that some or all of the tests currently fail

   ![Click testAll](screenshots/007-click-testall.png)

1. Read the test output to see that some tests have `FAIL` written

   ![Test failures](screenshots/008-test-failures.png)

1. Open the editor on the class for this task (that is, not the Submit class, but the class named after the problem you're solving)

   ![Open editor](screenshots/009-open-editor.png)

1. Sometimes BlueJ opens the file to a random line. If this happens, scroll up to the top, since you don't have to edit most of the methods in the given file.

   ![Open to random line](screenshots/010-open-to-random-line.png)

1. At the top of the file, you can now start implementing the algorithm to solve the given task

   ![Scroll to top](screenshots/011-scroll-to-top.png)

   ![Solve exercise](screenshots/012-solve-exercise.png)

1. Click Compile to see if you have any syntax or type errors to correct

   ![Click compile](screenshots/013-click-compile.png)

1. If your code compiled successfully, you can now click `testAll()` again to see if the tests pass

   ![Click testAll](screenshots/014-click-testall.png)

1. If the test output doesn't say `FAIL` anywhere, you're done!

   ![Test successes](screenshots/015-test-successes.png)

1. Right click `Submit` and choose `submit(String taskID, String username, String password)`.
   Remember to put "quotes" around the three strings.
   Find the Task ID in the task description.

   ![Click submit](screenshots/016-click-submit.png)

1. Enter the username and password your TA gave you, and enter the ID for this
   task. If the task ends in `"-2"`, that means you can get 1 point for a
   correct solution and an additional 1 point for a fast solution.

   ![Enter credentials](screenshots/017-enter-credentials.png)

1. Your code will be submitted to the automated judge, and after a while you will see the judgement.
   Remember to switch to the console window of BlueJ if it doesn't appear automatically.

Common mistakes
---------------

* **Submitting code that calls System.out for debugging.**
  System.out.println() is a good tool to use if you can't find out why your solution doesn't work.
  However, the judge gets confused if you leave in calls to System.out.println()
  when submitting your code, since it looks at the output of the main() method
  to determine if your solution is correct.
  Remember to comment out any System.out-lines in your own code before calling submit()!

If you believe there are other common mistakes that should be mentioned in this list,
let us know on the Blackboard discussion board.
